This project is a simple CRUD where I can create, read, update and delete something.

In this case I can create a character, go to the saved characters screen and then I can update each character's phrase and delete their card.

The frontend used: Javascript + HTML + CSS.

For the backend, I used Fastify, which is a Node.js web framework focused on high performance and ease of use.

I used the NEON database (https://console.neon.tech).
